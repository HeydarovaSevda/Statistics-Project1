This project involves a statistical analysis of gym member data to uncover relationships between variables like workout types, experience levels, session durations and calories burned. Using Excel, I performed descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, confidence interval calculations, Chi-Square tests and regression analysis. Key findings include a strong positive correlation between session duration and calories burned and a significant impact of experience level on workout efficiency. This project highlights my ability to apply statistical methods to real-world datasets and extract actionable insights.
